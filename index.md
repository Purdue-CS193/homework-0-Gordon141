## Hello world!

There's not much here for now. 

# Bulleted List
- I like the less formal nature of this class, having super serious classes gets boring
- I like how the instructors are people closer to our age
- I like how it meets only once a week. I'm not saying that I enjoy enjkoy lisitening to you, but as a new student trying to manage my time having one less lecture to worry about helps with the stress.
